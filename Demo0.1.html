      <p> In this study, you will be walking through a set of questions related to a general topic.
        For each question, we are interested to see your data expectations related to the given attributes.
        Your main task is to provide your expectation on the data points, using the provided interface.
        <br>
        <br>You will be working with two types of visualizations. The first type of visualization would display values for each of the categories on the horizontal axis. 
        <br>
        <br>The examples below display human heights across different age groups.
        Each black dot indicates the average height for the corresponding group, while each grey dot represents an individual person.
        The grey dots keep moving because they are different sets of hypothetical people.
        <br>
        <br>Both figures here show that the average height for adults is the highest while the average height for children is the lowest. However, the left figure
        indicates that people in each age group would have similar heights, while the right figure indicates that heights in each group would vary.
